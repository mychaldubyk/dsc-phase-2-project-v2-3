##  Overview
We are a data science consulting company looking to provide predictive and actionable insights regarding sale pricing for relators.The analysis of variables such as price, price per square foot, distance from Seattle using latitude and longitudes, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms. 

Our presentation, where we analyze our dataset can be found at:

## Business and Data Understanding 

We are sourcing the data for this project from the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found at `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this assignment's GitHub repository. The column name descriptions can also be found in this data folder, under the name 'column_names.md'.





## Modeling






## Regression Results

Recall that communication is one of the key data science "soft skills". In Phase 2, we are specifically focused on Statistical Communication. We define Statistical Communication as:

> Communicating **results of statistical analyses** to diverse audiences via writing and live presentation

Note that this is the same as in Phase 1, except we are replacing "basic data analysis" with "statistical analyses".

High-quality Statistical Communication includes rationale, results, limitations, and recommendations:

* **Rationale:** Explaining why you are using statistical analyses rather than basic data analysis
  * For example, why are you using regression coefficients rather than just a graph?
  * What about the problem or data is suitable for this form of analysis?
  * For a data science audience, this includes your reasoning for the changes you applied while iterating between models.
* **Results:** Describing the overall model metrics and feature coefficients
  * You need at least one overall model metric (e.g. r-squared or RMSE) and at least two feature coefficients.
  * For a business audience, make sure you connect any metrics to real-world implications. You do not need to get into the details of how linear regression works.
  * For a data science audience, you don't need to explain what a metric is, but make sure you explain why you chose that particular one.
* **Limitations:** Identifying the limitations and/or uncertainty present in your analysis
  * This could include p-values/alpha values, confidence intervals, assumptions of linear regression, missing data, etc.
  * In general, this should be more in-depth for a data science audience and more surface-level for a business audience.
* **Recommendations:** Interpreting the model results and limitations in the context of the business problem
  * What should stakeholders _do_ with this information?
